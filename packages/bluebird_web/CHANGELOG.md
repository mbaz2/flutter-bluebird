## Unreleased
- `connect` accepts the caller's timeout and does nothing with it: Web Bluetooth cannot cancel a pending `connect()`, so the deadline stays with the Dart side.

## 0.4.2

- Fixed a spurious `deviceDisconnected` when a device is disconnected and quickly reconnected. The browser dispatches `gattserverdisconnected` asynchronously in response to `disconnect()`, so the delayed event could land on the freshly re-established connection, wipe its attribute cache, and drive it back to `disconnected`. `disconnect()` now treats that event as the single source of truth and waits for it to be handled before returning, so the straggler is consumed before any reconnect begins.
